By leveraging a TLB and page table, addressing page faults, and implementing various page replacement strategies, this system successfully maintains virtual memory. It converts logical addresses to physical addresses and keeps track of different information relating to page faults and TLB hits.
Implementation of a virtual memory management system that maps logical addresses to physical locations using a two-level page table and a translation look-aside buffer (TLB). Support for various page replacement rules, such as Second Chance and Least Recently Used (LRU), is included in the implementation.
