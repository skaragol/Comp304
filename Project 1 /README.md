The main part of the project requires you to develop an interactive Unix-style operating
system shell, called Mishell in C. After executing Mishell, it will read commands from the
user and execute them. Some of these commands will be builtin commands, i.e., specific to
Mishell and not available in other shells, while others will be regular programs such as ls
and echo.
