The main part of the project requires you to develop an interactive Unix-style operating system shell, called Mishell in C. After executing Mishell, it will read commands from the user and execute them. Some of these commands will be builtin commands, i.e., specific to Mishell and not available in other shells, while others will be regular programs such as ls and echo.
The project's goal is to create an interactive Unix-style operating system shell. In C, this is known  as Mishell. Once completing all of the necessary Mishell implementations and adding the  necessary commands, the entire program may be performed once the user executes the  program using the makefile provided to us on github. There will be four primary tasks in this  project, which will comprise some built-in commands, implementing operators or regular  programs
